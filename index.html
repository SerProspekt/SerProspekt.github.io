                I started programming several years ago with my father, a retired Aramco Electrical Engineer/Computer Programmer. He introduced me to programming, we programmed an AC remote controller/temperature sensing device using an Arduino based micro controller ESP 8266.
                The language we used was C++ using the Arduino IDE. Since then I fell in love with programming. I wrote several C# programs before moving to C++ where I decided to develop my own game. On my way to developing my game I had to develop several tools namely
                a game engine and all of what it entails (Registry System, ECS, Asset Manager, Renderer, Editor... etc) As with any good piece of software the work never ends, so I decided to document my progress to showcase every tool I develop until I finish my game.

            <div class="section-content">
                <h3><a href="#" onclick="window.location.href='/Projects/PageRegistry.html'">Page Registry</a></h3>
                <p>The absolute core of the Page framework, this is the tool that manages all of Page's data, it ensures safety across DLL/SO boundaries. It is also container agnostic meaning the user can provide his own container for managing data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-content">
                <h3><a href="#" onclick="window.location.href='/Projects/PageECS.html'">Page ECS</a></h3>
                <p>An extremely flexible ECS, which supports modern systems application design and also the classical OOP design.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-content">
                <h3><a href="#" onclick="window.location.href='/Projects/PageEditor.html'">Page Editor</a></h3>
                <p>Built using the excellent ImGui, a run-of-the-mill editor at the moment in all but Page's greatest utility, the PropertyManager, a powerful tool that allows the user to control aspects of components visually. Its simplicity belies a sophisticated highly extensible implementation.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <h3><a href="#" onclick="window.location.href='/Projects/PageEngine.html'">Page Engine</a></h3>
                <p>A completely reloadable native graphics engine written in C++ that can render arbitrary graphics on all modern platforms: Desktop/Mobile/Web.</p>

                <h3><a href="#" onclick="window.location.href='/Game/App_Executable.html'">Idle Breakout</a></h3>
                <p>A simple game, made in C++ from scratch (no engine) compiled to WASM using Emscripten.</p>
